# Predicting-the-Likelihood-of-E-signing-a-Loan-based-on-Financial-History


INTRODUCTION
Lending Companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants, and choosing whether or not the applicant is too risky to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the applicant then determines the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants, companies can organically recieve them through their websites/apps, often with the help of advertisement campaigns. Other times lending companies partner with peer to peer(P2P) lending marketplaces, in order to acquire leads of possible applicants. Some example marketpleces include Upstart, Lending Tree and Lending Club.In this project we are going to assess the quality of the leads of our comapny recieves from these marketplaces.

Market: The target audience is the set of loan applicants who reached out through an intermediary markerplace.
2.Product: A loan.

3.Goal: Develop a model to predict for quality applicants. In this case study, quality applicants are those who reach a key part of the loan application process.

In this case study, we will be working for a fintech company that specializes on loans. It offers low APR loans to applicants based on theor financial habits, as almost all lending companies do. This company has partnered with a P2P lending marketplace that provides real time needs. The number of conversions from these leads are satisfactory.

The company tasks you with creating a model that predicts whether or not these leads will complete the electronic signaturephase of the loan application. The company seeks to leverage this model to identify less quality applicants(eg those who are not responding to the onboarding process), and experiment with giving them different boarding screens.
